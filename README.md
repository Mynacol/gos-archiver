This script searches for current releases on [https://grapheneos.org/releases](https://grapheneos.org/releases), downloads them and uploads them to archive.org to archive the releases.
They contain signatures, this way their authenticity can be checked by anyone.

The saved archives on archive.org can be found with [a search](https://archive.org/search?query=creator%3A%22GrapheneOS%22+title%3A%22GrapheneOS+release%22&sort=-addeddate).
